You must create a program called stockholm with these specifications:
• It must be developed for the Linux platform.
◦ The program must have the option "–help" or "-h" to display the help.
◦ The program must have the option "–version" or "-v" to show the version of
the program.
◦ The program must have the option "–reverse" or "-r" followed by the key entered
as an argument to reverse the infection.
◦ The program must show each encrypted file during the process unless the
option is indicated "–silent" or "-s", in which case the program will not produce
any output.
• The program have to handle errors and will not stop unexpectedly in any case.
Your program must perform several actions described below:
• It must only work in a folder called infection in the user’s HOME directory.
• The program will only act on files whose extensions have been affected by Wannacry.
The program have to encrypt the contents of the files in this folder using a key.
• Files must be encrypted with a known algorithm of your choice, which is considered
secure.
• The program must rename all the files in the mentioned folder adding the ".ft"
extension.
• If they already have this extension, they will not be renamed.
• The key with which the files are encrypted will be at least 16 characters long.
• The program must be able to do the reverse operation using the encryption key in
order to restore the files to their original state.
To make this program you can use any language you want. However:
• You must add a file of maximum 50 lines called README.md to the root of your
repository. This file should contain instructions for use and, if necessary, for com-
pilation.
• You must add to the root of your repository a Makefile to configure the files so that
the program can be run.
• In any case, you must include all the source code of the program
